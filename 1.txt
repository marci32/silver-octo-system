Scenario1: merge

feat1: feat1 --PR#1--> staging --PR#2--> production
 - result: staging is behind production with one merge commit (PR #2)

feat2: feat2 --PR#3--> staging --PR#4--> production
 - result: staging is behind production with two merge commits (PR #2 and PR #4)

feat3: feat3 --PR#5--> staging
feat4: feat4 --PR#6--> staging --PR#7--> production
 - result: staging is behind production with three merge commits (PR #2, PR #4 and PR #7)
   (PR #7 contains feat3 and feat4)

(merge prod to stg - fast-forward -, no diff between staging and production at all)

Scenario2: squash from feature to staging, rebase from staging to production

feat1sc2: feat1sc2 --PR#8--> staging --PR#9--> production
